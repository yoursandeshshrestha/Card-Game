## Remember & Reveal (The Memory Challenge Game)

Remember & Reveal is a card game designed to help you unwind from the daily noise. It's a single-player game that requires a sharp intellect to conquer.

## How to Play

The game consists of 16 cards, each with a matching pair. Your task is to find all the matching pairs within 30 seconds to win the game.

- If you successfully match all the cards, you'll see "You won" as the result.
- If you fail to match all the cards within the time limit, you'll see "You lose".

It's that simple, but winning this game may require a good IQ!
